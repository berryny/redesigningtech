          <h2>About Redesigning Technology Corporation</h2>
          <p>Judith founded Redesigning Technology Corporation in 1999. As the computer industry was rapidly changing, she saw many businesses and individuals discarding their hardware and software for newer models - well before their time. It dawned on Judith that a more efficient way to view computers was to see why they were not responding - a more costly and efficient method to maximizing a computer's longetivity. Judith's viewpoint was that software and hardware just needed to be reconfigured. She began consulting with individuals and small businesses to help them understand how a computer could last longer and adopted the name Redesigning Technology Corp.</p>
